# gaza_citizenjournalism
A repository of citizen journalists on the ground in Gaza posting information direct from the source (as opposed to through the filter of legacy media).

I have been bothered by the biased and unreliable way the legacy media are reporting on the conflict, therefore, I have decided to make this repository to help amass a collection of citizen journalists who are reporting from the ground.

Every measure should be taken to ensure every addition to this list is as unbiased and accurate as possible. The intention of this repo is to mitigate propaganda/psyops and ensure that truthful information is disseminated to the surface which will in turn allow for those alienated from the conflict to discern the most truthful perspective.

This repository is not about politics, but for the documentation of truth and reality.

Please feel free to submit pull requests.
