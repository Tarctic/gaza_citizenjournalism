Each PR MUST respect the following guidelines:


- Ensure the citizen journalist is reporting factual information.

- That the contribution is placed within the list alphabetically.

- That the citizen journalist does not already exist in the list.

- There is exactly one space on both sides between the citizen journalist name and the surrounding pipes. Same should be true for the description, languages and platform fields.

- Correct grammar and spelling.

- If you are creating a link to X/Twitter, use 'x.com' rather than 'twitter.com'.

- You should add the contribution in the README.md file using this pattern:

<br>
<br>

```javascript
| [Citizen Journalist Name](URL) | Description | Languages | Platform |
```
